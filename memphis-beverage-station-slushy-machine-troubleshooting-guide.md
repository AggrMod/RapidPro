# Memphis Beverage Station and Slushy Machine Troubleshooting Guide

This quick guide is for restaurant teams, hotels, and convenience stores that need fast checks before calling for service.

## Beverage Station: Most Common Issues

### 1. Beverage station not dispensing correctly
Q: Why is flow weak or inconsistent?  
A: Check syrup bag level, CO2 pressure, and clogged nozzles first. Replace kinked lines.

### 2. Beverage station leaking under the counter
Q: Where do leaks usually start?  
A: Quick-connect fittings, drain tubing, and worn O-rings are common failure points.

### 3. Drinks taste off or flat
Q: What should we verify immediately?  
A: Sanitize nozzles and lines, then inspect water filtration and syrup expiration dates.

## Slushy Machine: Most Common Issues

### 1. Slushy machine not freezing
Q: Why does the mix stay liquid?  
A: Confirm freeze mode is active, verify proper sugar ratio, and check condenser airflow.

### 2. Auger or barrel not turning
Q: What should we check first?  
A: Inspect breaker status, drive coupler wear, and signs of product over-freezing in the barrel.

### 3. Slushy machine keeps tripping the breaker
Q: Is this electrical or mechanical?  
A: It can be either. Verify dedicated breaker sizing, then run amp-draw diagnostics on compressor and motor.
