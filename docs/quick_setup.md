### At Each Restaurant
1. **Introduction Script**:

   - Explain Rapid Pro Maintenance services
   - Mention preventative maintenance benefits
   - Discuss estimated cost savings

2. **Service Overview**:
   - Brief walk-through of our PM process (5-10 minutes)
   - Show demo of our reporting system on tablet
   - Demonstrate PDF export of sample report
   - Explain follow-up process

3. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Quick visual inspection of refrigeration equipment
   - Note any immediate concerns or visible issues
   - Identify potential improvement areas
   - Collect basic information about their equipment

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Schedule comprehensive PM visit if interested
   - Leave business card and service brochure
   - Set expectations for follow-up communication
   - Thank them for their time

## Conversion Goals
- Aim for at least 5% initial interest rate
- Target 2-3 signed service agreements by end of week
- Collect contact information from all visited locations

Remember, this first round is primarily for introductions. Even a 1% conversion rate would be a successful start, so focus on making positive impressions rather than rushing through the process.
