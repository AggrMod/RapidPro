### Current Sprint Focus
Team Member 1 has implemented the form validation library for the first six forms in the PM workflow (Client Identification, Work Authorization, Equipment Identification, Temperature & Gasket inspection, Sink & Plumbing checks, and Coil Cleaning). The validation system includes auto-save functionality, data persistence, and form resumption capabilities. Next, we'll continue integrating the form validation library with the remaining workflow forms (Gas Equipment, Minor Repairs, Rooftop Maintenance, and Final Report).

We've also created a restaurant visit schedule for the upcoming week, starting in White Haven and working outward. The schedule includes restaurant locations, contact information, and equipment lists to streamline the PM visits.

Team Member 2 has completed the notifications system, parts ordering functionality, and PDF export feature for completed PM reports. Currently focusing on making all dashboard pages fully mobile-responsive.

## Implementation Notes

### Form Validation Library
- Created a comprehensive form validation library (`form-validation.js`) for all PM workflow forms
- Key features include:

## Restaurant Visit Schedule

We've prepared a detailed restaurant visit schedule for next week (May 12-16, 2025), starting in White Haven and working outward. The full schedule is available in `restaurant_schedule.md` and includes:

- 20 restaurant visits over 5 days
- Organized by geographic area for efficiency
- Complete with contact information and equipment counts
- 2-hour time slots allowing for thorough PM inspections

The schedule prioritizes White Haven establishments on Monday and Tuesday, then expands to Riverside, Beale Street, and Downtown/Midtown areas for the remainder of the week.

## Notes for Team Member 2
The TodoRead and TodoWrite tools are used in our code editor sessions to maintain the task list. You won't see this as a physical file, but you can request the current task list during your session.

Great job completing the PDF export functionality for PM reports! The export looks clean and includes all the necessary information in a well-formatted document.

To stay organized:
1. Keep notes of your implementation details in this file
2. Update the to-do list as you complete tasks
3. Coordinate with Team Member 1 (me) on shared components

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining form validations for PM workflow forms
2. Prepare equipment and supplies for restaurant visits starting Monday
3. Finalize the mobile app integration for on-site PM tracking 
4. Begin White Haven restaurant visits according to the schedule
5. Complete mobile-responsive design for remaining dashboard pages
6. Test PDF export functionality with actual PM data during restaurant visits

Next sprint planning meeting scheduled for May 15, 2025.
We'll review sprint progress and prepare for the next phase of development.
