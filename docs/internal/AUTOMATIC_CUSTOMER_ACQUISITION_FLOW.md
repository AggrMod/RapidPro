🚨 CRITICAL MISSION IN 10 MINUTES

⏰ 4:00 PM - RETURN TO ARCADE RESTAURANT

🎯 MISSION BRIEF:

Yesterday's intel: "Cashier said owner will be in
after 4 PM today."

YOUR OBJECTIVE:
Speak to owner, introduce services, gauge interest.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👔 APPROACH SCRIPT:

[Walk in confidently]

"Hi! I stopped by yesterday and spoke with [cashier's
name if you remember]. She mentioned the owner would
be in around this time. Is he/she available?"

[When you meet owner]

"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with RapidPro Memphis. I specialize
in commercial refrigeration for restaurants like yours.
I was in the neighborhood and wanted to introduce myself.

Quick question - who handles your refrigeration
maintenance currently?"

[LISTEN - adjust based on response]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 LOCATION: 540 S Main St, Memphis, TN 38103

⏱️ ARRIVE BY: 3:58 PM (be early, not late)

[GET DIRECTIONS]  [I'M HERE]
```

**You:** Drive there, walk in, execute conversation

**You:** Owner says "We handle it ourselves mostly. Only call someone when something breaks."

**You:** Continue conversation, leave card, return to vehicle

```
📝 LOG INTERACTION - ARCADE RESTAURANT

You met the owner. What happened?

[TYPE FULL DETAILS]

Include:
- Owner's name (if you got it)
- What they said about current service
- Their reaction to your pitch
- Any interest level / next steps
```

**You:** Type "Met owner John. They don't have regular maintenance, only call when things break. He seemed interested in preventative approach but said 'we're pretty tight on budget right now, maybe in a few months.' I left my card. He said call him in March when they start spring prep."

**AI Thinks:**
```
🤖 Analyzing...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Owner contact: SUCCESSFUL
✅ Name obtained: John
✅ Current approach: Reactive only
✅ Budget objection: "Tight on budget"
✅ Future interest: "Maybe in a few months"
✅ Specific timeline: "Call in March (spring prep)"

Analysis: MEDIUM-PRIORITY NURTURE LEAD
Not ready to buy now, but clear future opportunity.
The "spring prep" angle is solid - restaurants do
increase spending before busy season.

Recommended: Respect the timeline, follow up in March.
Don't push now - he'll remember you when ready.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**AI Shows:**
```
✅ INTERACTION LOGGED

🤖 AI DECISION:

John is not ready to buy now, but this is a GOOD
interaction. Here's why:

1. You met the decision-maker (not just gatekeeper)
2. He didn't reject - he gave you a future timeline
3. "Spring prep" is a real budget event for restaurants
4. You left a positive impression (he gave timeline)

IMMEDIATE ACTION: None. Don't push.

SCHEDULED ACTION CREATED:
⏰ March 1st, 10:00 AM
   Call John at Arcade Restaurant
   Reference: "You mentioned calling in March for
   spring prep. Is now a good time to discuss that
   preventative maintenance plan?"

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 45% this converts (medium)

## 🧠 AI Decision Examples

### Example 1: Unexpected Response

**You log:** "Owner said 'I'm actually looking to sell this place in the next few months, so I'm not making any new commitments.'"

**AI Thinks:**
```
🤖 Analysis:
- Business is for sale
- Owner won't commit to new vendors
- This is a dead lead... OR IS IT?

💡 CREATIVE STRATEGY:

This owner won't buy, but the BUYER might need you.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
"I completely understand. Out of curiosity, do you
know who's buying it? I'd love to introduce myself
to the new owner when they take over - they'll need
a reliable refrigeration partner."

If owner gives name/info → New lead (future buyer)
If owner declines → Politely thank and move on

This turns a dead lead into a potential referral.
```

### Example 2: Competitor Mentioned

**You log:** "Owner said they use XYZ Refrigeration and are happy with them."

**AI Thinks:**
```
🤖 Analysis:
- Competitor relationship: Strong (they said "happy")
- Immediate conversion: Unlikely
- Opportunity: Become the backup option

💡 STRATEGIC RESPONSE:

Don't try to steal the customer now. Plant a seed.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
"That's great to hear! XYZ does good work. I'm not
here to replace them. But if you ever need a second
opinion or they're unavailable in an emergency, keep
my card handy. I'm local and can respond same-day."

This positions you as:
- Respectful (not badmouthing competitor)
- Helpful (emergency backup)
- Memorable (he'll call you if XYZ drops the ball)

SCHEDULED ACTION:
⏰ Check back in 6 months
   "Just wanted to touch base - how's everything
   running? Still happy with XYZ?"
```

### Example 3: Budget Objection

**You log:** "Owner interested but said '$X/month is too expensive.'"

**AI Thinks:**
```
🤖 Analysis:
- Interest: YES
- Objection: Price (not value)
- This is negotiable

💡 PRICE OBJECTION STRATEGY:

Don't drop price immediately. Understand the gap.

RECOMMENDED RESPONSE:
"I understand - what budget did you have in mind
for monthly maintenance?"

[PAUSE - LET THEM GIVE A NUMBER]

If their number is close (within 20%):
"I can work with that. Let me see what I can do."
→ Adjust scope: Fewer visits, less equipment coverage

If their number is too low (50%+ gap):
"I hear you. Let me ask - have you had any major
breakdowns recently?"
→ Reframe: Cost of maintenance vs cost of emergency

FALLBACK OPTION:
"How about this - let me do your first service for
[reduced rate] as a trial. If you see the value,
we can discuss ongoing maintenance. Fair?"

This gets you in the door. Once they see your work,
price objections disappear.
