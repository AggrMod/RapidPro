# Walk-In Cooler Not Keeping Temp in Memphis: Manager Q&A and First Checks

When a walk-in cooler drifts above safe holding temperature, speed matters. Use this checklist to stabilize risk and collect useful diagnostics.

## Q&A

## Q1: What are the first 3 checks for a warm walk-in cooler?

A:

1. Confirm door closes tightly and sweep/gasket are intact.
2. Confirm evaporator fans are running.
3. Confirm the walk-in breaker is ON and not partially tripped.

## Q2: How do I inspect the walk-in door seal quickly?

A:

- Inspect full perimeter gasket for tears or compression set.
- Check hinges and closer for misalignment.
- Verify door self-closes and does not rebound open.
- Check for visible light leaks from inside the box.

## Q3: Should walk-in cooler fans run continuously?

A:

In most normal cooling cycles, yes, you should see active air movement. If fans are off for long periods, call service because coil freeze control, motors, or controls may be failing.

## Q4: What breaker setup should I expect?

A:

Walk-ins are often on dedicated multi-pole circuits. Smaller systems may be two-pole; larger systems can use three-pole equipment feeds. Always verify against your panel directory and equipment nameplate.

## Q5: What does a proper breaker panel check look like?

A:

1. Review panel directory on breaker door.
2. Locate the walk-in circuit label.
3. Verify correct breaker handle state.
4. If tripped, reset only once per policy.
5. If it trips again, leave OFF and dispatch service.

## Q6: What signs indicate airflow or coil problems?

A:

- Weak air movement at evaporator discharge
- Uneven temperatures by shelf location
- Ice accumulation on evaporator
- Water around door threshold after defrost cycles

## Q7: What can my team do while waiting for service?

A:

- Minimize door openings
- Consolidate product away from warm zones
- Keep strip curtains clear and intact
- Stage backup cold storage if temperature keeps rising

## When to escalate immediately

- Product above safe hold threshold
- Repeated breaker trips
- No fan operation
