This page is designed for fast triage when prep-line, reach-in, or remote refrigeration systems stop holding temperature.

## Q&A

## Q1: What is the fastest way to triage a no-cooling event?

A:

1. Confirm power path: breaker, disconnect, control power.
2. Confirm thermostat/controller setpoint and mode.
3. Confirm condenser and evaporator fan operation.
4. Inspect door seals and door-ajar behavior.
5. Reduce door openings and protect product immediately.

## Q2: Could breaker issues be the root cause?

A:

Yes. Many commercial systems use dedicated multi-pole circuits. Verify panel directory labels and breaker state. If a breaker trips repeatedly, do not continue resetting.

## Q3: What if fans run but temperature still climbs?

A:

Likely causes include refrigerant issues, restricted coils, control faults, or compressor problems. Fan operation alone does not confirm active cooling.

## Q4: What operational mistakes make cooling failures worse?

A:

- Blocking return air paths with product
- Leaving doors open during line prep
- Delaying condenser cleaning
- Ignoring gasket failures
- Storing warm product directly in holding boxes

## Q5: What should managers check in the panel documentation?

A:

Use the breaker directory on the panel door to confirm the correct circuit. If labels are missing or outdated, update documentation to reduce downtime during emergencies.

## Q6: What are hard-stop signs that require immediate service?

A:

- No compressor start
- Persistent high-temp alarm
- Repeated breaker trip
- Burnt odor at disconnect or panel
- Product entering unsafe range
