## Q&A

## Q1: How often should commercial coolers and freezers be inspected?

A:

- Daily: temperature logs, door close verification, obvious leak checks
- Weekly: gasket condition, fan noise, drain path check
- Monthly: condenser cleanliness, electrical connection inspection, alarm review
- Quarterly: full PM with documented findings and corrective actions

## Q2: What are the most overlooked PM items?

A:

- Door gasket degradation before visible tearing
- Loose hinge/closer hardware
- Dirty condenser coils in greasy environments
- Breaker panel directory not matching equipment labels
- Missing PM history by asset

## Q3: Why does breaker panel documentation matter for refrigeration uptime?

A:

When systems fail during service, teams lose time locating the correct circuit. Accurate panel labeling on the breaker door shortens response time and improves safety during resets.

## Q4: What can staff do without opening equipment panels?

A:

- Confirm setpoints and alarm status
- Confirm fans are running
- Inspect gasket seal and door alignment
- Verify breaker handle state
- Capture photos and notes for technician handoff

## Q5: What should be in a PM record?

A:

- Asset ID, model, serial
- Date/time and technician
- Temperatures before and after service
- Parts replaced and corrective actions
- Recommended follow-up date

## Q6: When does preventive maintenance become emergency repair?

A:

When temperature cannot be maintained, alarms persist, breakers trip repeatedly, or product safety is at risk. At that point, dispatch should move from routine PM to emergency service.
