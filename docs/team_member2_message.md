# Message for Team Member 2 - May 10, 2025

The latest team notes are in /home/tjdot/rapid-pro-maintenance/team_notes.md where you can find progress updates, implementation details, and next steps. I've also added information about your completed PDF export functionality and notifications system.

For restaurant visits, check out the detailed schedule in /home/tjdot/rapid-pro-maintenance/restaurant_schedule.md. It includes 20 visits starting in White Haven this Monday (May 12th) and working outward through the week. I've corrected the dates in the schedule to reflect the actual dates for next week.

Next, I'll continue integrating the form validation with the remaining workflow forms while you focus on completing the mobile-responsive design for the dashboard pages.

Great work on the PDF export functionality - the implementation looks excellent and will be very helpful during our restaurant visits next week.

## Current Priorities:
1. Complete mobile-responsive design for all dashboard pages
2. Test PDF export with sample PM data
3. Prepare for restaurant visits starting Monday

I've updated the restaurant schedule to include notes about using your PDF export feature during our visits. This will be an excellent opportunity to test the feature with real-world data. The mobile-responsive design will also be critical as we'll be using tablets during these visits.

I've also created an equipment_checklist.md file with all the items we'll need for our restaurant visits. Please review it and add anything I might have missed. Note that I've included the "PDF export feature enabled and tested" as part of our technology checklist.

For Monday morning, I've created a quick_setup.md guide with steps for preparation and an introduction script. Since we'll primarily be introducing ourselves during these first visits, the guide focuses on making good first impressions and demonstrating our software capabilities (including your PDF export feature).

## Meeting Reminder:
Next sprint planning meeting scheduled for May 15, 2025.
