# Bridge Building Mode

## Overview
Bridge Building mode is designed for initial visits to new restaurant prospects, focusing on relationship development rather than maintenance services. This approach helps establish trust and gather information without creating pressure for immediate service agreements.

## Key Components

### 1. Introduction Process
- Brief company introduction (30-60 seconds)
- Ask about their current kitchen equipment
- Inquire about their maintenance challenges
- Listen more than speak

### 2. Information Collection
- Business details
- Key contact information
- Equipment types and brands
- Current maintenance approach
- Pain points and challenges

### 3. Follow-up Strategy
- Leave business card and company information
- Set expectations for follow-up communication
- Note any specific interests or needs
- Schedule follow-up if appropriate

## Dashboard Implementation

The dashboard has been updated to support Bridge Building mode with these features:

1. **Terminology Changes**:
   - "PM Sessions" renamed to "Bridge Building" in navigation and reports
   - "Inspections" renamed to "Visits" throughout the interface
   - "Service Authorization" replaced with "Visit Notes"

2. **Simplified Forms**:
   - Less technical approach to information gathering
   - Focus on relationship-building fields
   - Optional equipment documentation
   - Emphasis on notes and follow-up planning

3. **Photo Documentation**:
   - Business exterior photos
   - Equipment photos (when permitted)
   - Business card capture
   - Menu photos for reference

4. **Success Metrics**:
   - Track visit completion
   - Record interest level (1-5 scale)
   - Note follow-up timing preference
   - Document specific opportunities identified

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Approach**:
   - Visit during non-peak hours (typically 2-4pm)
   - Ask to speak with manager or owner
   - Be brief and respectful of their time
   - Express genuine interest in their business

2. **Conversation Starters**:
   - "How long have you been in business here?"
   - "What type of refrigeration equipment do you rely on most?"
   - "How do you currently handle equipment maintenance?"
   - "What's been your biggest challenge with kitchen equipment?"

3. **Building Trust**:
   - Share brief relevant experience
   - Offer a quick tip or insight if appropriate
   - Don't criticize their current maintenance approach
   - Focus on understanding, not selling

4. **Closing the Visit**:
   - Thank them for their time
   - Leave contact information
   - Set clear next steps
   - Respect their decision regarding follow-up

## Implementation Notes

The Bridge Building approach is integrated throughout the dashboard system, creating a relationship-focused workflow for all new restaurant visits. This approach maximizes the chance of developing long-term service relationships without creating pressure during initial contacts.
