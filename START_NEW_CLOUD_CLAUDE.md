## ⚡ The 30-Second Briefing

When you open the new Cloud Claude instance, just say:

> "Hi Cloud Claude! The previous instance crashed. I need you to read these files to get up to speed:
>
> 1. **CLOUD_CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md** - Essential commands
> 2. **CLOUD_CLAUDE_BRIEFING.md** - Full context
>
> These explain the auto-deployment system that's now in place. You can push changes to GitHub and they'll automatically deploy to Firebase. LOCAL Claude set everything up for you."
