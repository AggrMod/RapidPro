## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Bridge Building Mode vs Standard PM Mode
**Decision**: Use Bridge Building Mode as primary
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with business model of prospecting
- Better for relationship-first approach
- Can still handle maintenance tasks
- More flexible for various client types

### 2. Local-First Architecture
**Decision**: Use localStorage and service workers
**Rationale**:
- Works offline for field technicians
- Fast performance
- No server dependencies initially
- Easy to sync when online

### 3. Static Site with Dynamic Dashboard
**Decision**: Keep public site static, dashboard dynamic
**Rationale**:
- Better SEO for public pages
- Fast loading times
- Secure separation of concerns
- Easy to deploy on GitHub Pages

## Notes for Future Developers

1. **State Management**: Currently using vanilla JS with localStorage. Consider Redux/Zustand for complex state.

2. **Component Architecture**: Dashboard uses vanilla JS. Consider React/Vue for better component management.

3. **Testing**: No automated tests yet. Implement Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E.

4. **Build Process**: Currently no build process. Consider Webpack/Vite for optimization.

5. **TypeScript**: Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety.
