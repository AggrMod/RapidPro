## STEP 1: Create Your Google Business Profile

### 1.1 Go to Google Business Profile Manager
**URL:** https://business.google.com

- Use your Google account (Gmail)
- If you don't have one, create a Google account first

### 1.3 Click "Manage now" or "Add your business"

### 1.4 Enter Business Name
```
Rapid Pro Maintenance
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Use the EXACT name you want to show in Google Maps.

---

## STEP 2: Choose Business Category

### 2.1 Primary Category (MOST IMPORTANT)
```
Commercial Refrigerator Repair Service
```

**Why this one?** Highest search volume for your target market.

### 2.2 Add Secondary Categories (Add these too)
Click "Add another category" and add:
1. `Appliance Repair Service`
2. `Commercial Cleaning Service` (if you offer maintenance plans)

**Expert's rule:** Use 2-4 categories minimum. We're using 3.

---

## STEP 3: Add Business Location

### 3.1 Choose Location Type
**Select:** "I deliver goods and services to my customers"

**Why?** You're a mobile service - you go to customer locations.

### 3.2 Enter Service Address
If Google requires a physical address for verification:
- Enter your home/office address
- You can HIDE this address from customers later
- Google just needs it for verification (postcard mailing)

### 3.3 Set Service Areas
Click "Add service area" and add each city:
1. Memphis, TN
2. Germantown, TN
3. Bartlett, TN
4. Collierville, TN
5. Cordova, TN
6. Southaven, MS
7. Olive Branch, MS

**💡 Tip:** You can also set a radius (e.g., "20 miles from Memphis") instead of individual cities.

---

## STEP 4: Add Contact Information

### 4.1 Phone Number
```
(901) 257-9417
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This MUST match the phone number on your website exactly!

### 4.2 Website URL
```
https://rapidpromemphis.com
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This MUST match your domain exactly!

---

## STEP 5: Verify Your Business

Google will ask you to verify. You have two options:

### Option A: Postcard Verification (Most Common)
1. Google mails a postcard to your business address
2. Takes 5-14 days to arrive
3. Postcard has a 5-digit verification code
4. Enter code in Google Business Profile

### Option B: Phone Verification (If Available)
1. Google calls your business phone
2. Automated system gives you a code
3. Enter code immediately

**⚠️ DO NOT skip verification!** Unverified businesses don't show in Google Maps.

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ **Don't use a PO Box** - Google won't verify
❌ **Don't use inconsistent business names** - "Rapid Pro" vs "Rapid Pro Maintenance"
❌ **Don't skip photos** - Photos increase engagement 35%
❌ **Don't ignore reviews** - Always respond within 24 hours
❌ **Don't stuff keywords** - Write naturally in description
❌ **Don't forget weekly posts** - Inactive profiles rank lower

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS FROM THE EXPERT:

1. **Categories matter more than anything** - Choose carefully!
2. **Fill out EVERY field** - Completion signals = trust signals
3. **Photos with geotags** - Take with your phone at job sites
4. **Respond to ALL reviews** - Even bad ones (professionally)
5. **Post weekly** - Keeps profile "active" in Google's eyes

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

**Google Business Profile Help:** https://support.google.com/business

**Verification Issues:**

- Try using your home address if business address fails
- Can take 2-3 weeks for postcard in some areas

**Can't Find Your Category:**

This is THE most important thing you can do for local SEO. 60-70% of clicks come from GBP, not your website.

Good luck! 🚀
