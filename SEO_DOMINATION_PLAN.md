## 🚀 Attack Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1) - Immediate Impact

  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Rapid Pro Memphis",
  "description": "Commercial Kitchen Equipment Repair & Preventative Maintenance",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Memphis",
    "addressRegion": "TN"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 35.1495,
    "longitude": -90.0490
  },
  "telephone": "+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX",
  "serviceArea": ["Memphis", "Germantown", "Bartlett", "Collierville"],

### Phase 2: Content Domination (Weeks 2-4)

#### Blog Strategy
Target competitor weaknesses with these articles:

   - Emergency keywords
   - Set service expectations

### Phase 3: Technical SEO (Weeks 3-6)

3. **Internal Linking**

### Phase 4: Local SEO Domination (Ongoing)

1. **Google Business Profile Optimization**
   - Complete all sections
   - Add photos regularly
   - Respond to reviews
   - Post weekly updates

2. **Local Citations**
   - Yelp (competitors ARE there)
   - BBB
   - Angi/HomeAdvisor
   - Memphis Chamber of Commerce
   - Local directories

3. **Service Area Pages**
   - `/germantown` - Target "germantown commercial kitchen repair"
   - `/bartlett` - Target "bartlett restaurant equipment"
