## Issues Found

1. **Issue**: `Error loading KPIs: FirebaseError: internal`
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Steps to reproduce**:
     1. Log in to the application.
     2. Refresh the page (F5).
     3. Check the browser console for the error.
     - **Note**: This error is intermittent and seems to happen after a page refresh. The KPIs still seem to update correctly after an interaction.

2. **Issue**: Geolocation permission prompt blocks testing.
   - **Severity**: Low (for testing)
   - **Steps to reproduce**:
     1. Click "CLOCK IN - GET MISSION".
     2. The application hangs waiting for location permission.
   - **Workaround**: Mocked the geolocation API using `browser_evaluate`. This is a common issue in headless browser environments.

## Recommendations

- [ ] System ready for production
- [x] Minor issues need fixing
- [ ] Major issues need fixing
- [ ] Requires additional testing

The main functionality of the application is working as expected. However, the intermittent KPI loading error should be investigated and fixed before deploying to production. The geolocation issue is likely specific to the testing environment and may not affect real users.
