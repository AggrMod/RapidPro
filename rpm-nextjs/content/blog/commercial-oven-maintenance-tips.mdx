# 5 Essential Commercial Oven Maintenance Tips

Your commercial oven is the heart of your kitchen. Keeping it in top condition isn't just about preventing breakdowns—it's about ensuring consistent food quality, energy efficiency, and food safety.

## 1. Clean Regularly and Thoroughly

The most important thing you can do for your oven is keep it clean. Built-up grease and food debris don't just affect taste—they can cause:

- Uneven heating
- Smoke and fire hazards
- Increased energy consumption
- Component damage

**Pro Tip:** Schedule a deep clean at least once a week, with daily wipe-downs of spills and splatters.

## 2. Check Door Seals Monthly

A damaged door seal can cause significant heat loss, leading to:

- Longer cooking times
- Higher energy bills
- Inconsistent results

Run your hand around the door while the oven is hot—if you feel heat escaping, it's time to replace the gasket.

## 3. Calibrate Temperature Settings

Commercial ovens can drift out of calibration over time. Use an oven thermometer to verify:

- Set temperature matches actual temperature
- Check at multiple settings (300°F, 400°F, 500°F)
- Compare readings at different rack positions

If you're off by more than 25°F, call us for professional calibration.

## 4. Inspect and Clean Burners

For gas ovens, burner maintenance is critical:

- Check flame color (should be blue, not yellow)
- Clear any blockages in burner ports
- Inspect gas connections for leaks

**Warning:** If you smell gas or see yellow flames, turn off the oven and call a professional immediately.

## 5. Don't Ignore Strange Noises or Smells

Your oven shouldn't make unusual sounds or emit strange odors. Common warning signs include:

- Clicking or buzzing sounds
- Burning smells (when oven is empty)
- Excessive smoke from vents
- Unusual vibrations

## When to Call a Professional

While regular maintenance can prevent many issues, some problems require expert attention:

- Inconsistent temperatures despite calibration
- Visible damage to heating elements
- Electrical issues or sparking
- Gas leaks or ignition problems
