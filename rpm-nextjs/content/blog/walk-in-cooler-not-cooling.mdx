# Walk-In Cooler Not Cooling? Here's What to Check

A failing walk-in cooler is every restaurant owner's nightmare. With thousands of dollars of inventory at stake, quick action is essential. Here are the most common causes and what you can do.

## Before You Panic: Quick Checks

Before calling for emergency service, verify these basics:

1. **Check the thermostat setting** - It may have been accidentally adjusted
2. **Verify power supply** - Check the breaker and ensure the unit is receiving power
3. **Look at the door seal** - A gap can prevent proper cooling
4. **Check for ice buildup** - Excessive frost indicates a defrost problem

## 7 Common Causes of Cooling Failure

### 1. Dirty Condenser Coils

The most common cause of cooling problems. When condenser coils are coated with dust and grease, they can't release heat effectively.

**Solution:** Schedule monthly condenser cleaning or call us for a maintenance visit.

### 2. Evaporator Fan Failure

If you don't hear the evaporator fan running, cold air isn't circulating properly.

**Signs:** Frost buildup on evaporator, warm spots in the cooler

### 3. Refrigerant Leak

Low refrigerant levels prevent proper cooling and can damage your compressor.

**Signs:** Hissing sounds, ice on refrigerant lines, compressor running constantly

**Important:** Only EPA-certified technicians can handle refrigerant repairs.

### 4. Defrost System Problems

If the defrost cycle isn't working, ice builds up and blocks airflow.

**Signs:** Excessive frost on evaporator coils, ice blocking vents

### 5. Failed Compressor

The compressor is the heart of your refrigeration system. When it fails, cooling stops.

**Signs:** Clicking sounds, compressor hot but not running, no cooling at all

### 6. Thermostat Malfunction

A faulty thermostat can cause the system to run too little or not at all.

**Signs:** Temperature doesn't match setting, system won't turn on

### 7. Door Seal Damage

Even small gaps in the door gasket cause significant heat gain.

**Signs:** Condensation around door, frost near gaps, unit running constantly

## Emergency Steps to Protect Your Inventory

If your cooler fails, take these steps immediately:

1. **Don't open the door** - An unopened cooler maintains temperature longer
2. **Check the temperature** - Use a thermometer to monitor internal temp
3. **Move critical items** - Transfer highly perishable items to backup refrigeration
4. **Document everything** - Take photos for insurance purposes
5. **Call for emergency repair** - The sooner, the better

## Temperature Safety Guidelines

Per FDA guidelines:
- Refrigerated foods must stay below 40°F
- Foods above 40°F for more than 2 hours should be discarded
- Document temperature readings for health department records
